= Task Tracker CLI
:toc:
:toclevels: 2

A simple command-line *Task Tracker* tool for managing tasks using plain text files.
The goal of this project is to create the perfect quick notetaking tool
for my usage.

== Basic Features

This is the basic functionality that I aim to achieve first and foremost:

* Create tasks from the command line
* List all tasks in a file
* Mark tasks as completed
* Edit or delete existing tasks
* Store tasks in plain text files
* No database or external service required

== Roadmap

I want to do so much with this app, I have come across many
technologies that I want to dive into.

My motivation has returned.

* Make extensive use of Picocli
* ASCII art
* Colour coded commands and text displays
* Web app functionality
* Deploy onto Netlify
* Authorisation and authentication flow
* DB connection
* UI/UX

Of course, the cli must be completed and its foundation must be built.
